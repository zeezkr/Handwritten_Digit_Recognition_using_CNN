# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_using_CNN
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9)
This has been a topic of boundless-research in the field of deep learning. Digit recognition has many applications like number plate recognition, postal mail sorting, bank check processing etc
In this implementation,i created a neural network to recognize a handwritten digit using TensorFlow and Keras. Using the MNIST dataset, this model can recognize handwritten digits which are being input to the model.
The neural network used is Sequential Model - Sequence models are basically the models in machine learning that analyze input sequences and produce output sequences of data. 
The MNIST dataset:
This is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
